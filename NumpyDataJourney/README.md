# Numpy Data Journey
##  ðŸ“Š Library Overview 
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides powerful N-dimensional arrays that are significantly faster than Python lists because the data is stored in one continuous place in memory. For optimal performance, its core routines are written in C and C++.
